#explain the pipeline and what it does:

#In Jenkins, a pipeline is a collection of events or jobs which are interlinked with one another in a sequence. It is a combination of plugins that support the integration and #implementation of continuous delivery pipelines using Jenkins. In other words, a Jenkins Pipeline is a collection of jobs or events that brings the software from version control #into the hands of the end users by using automation tools. It is used to incorporate continuous delivery in our software development workflow.

#Jenkins is, fundamentally, an automation engine which supports a number of automation patterns. Pipeline adds a powerful set of automation tools onto Jenkins, supporting use #cases that span from simple continuous integration to comprehensive CD pipelines. By modeling a series of related tasks, users can take advantage of the many features of #Pipeline:
#Code: Pipelines are implemented in code and typically checked into source control, giving teams the ability to edit, review, and iterate upon their delivery pipeline.
#Durable: Pipelines can survive both planned and unplanned restarts of the Jenkins controller.
#Pausable: Pipelines can optionally stop and wait for human input or approval before continuing the Pipeline run.
#Versatile: Pipelines support complex real-world CD requirements, including the ability to fork/join, loop, and perform work in parallel.
#Extensible: The Pipeline plugin supports custom extensions to its DSL [1] and multiple options for integration with other plugins.
